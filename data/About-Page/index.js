      "A road trip along Spain’s Mediterranean coast is a guarantee of sunshine, lovely beaches, and plenty of destinations with things to see and do. We suggest following the coastline at your own pace, without a fixed timetable and with room to improvise.We choose Barcelona as a starting point because it’s a huge transport hub. You might fancy heading north for a couple of days to see the Costa Brava (Girona): beautiful bays like Roses, coves where the pine trees grow right to the shoreline, large seaside resorts and the fishing villages that once inspired Dalí.",
